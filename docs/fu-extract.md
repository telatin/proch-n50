# MODERN ALTERNATIVE

This suite of tools has been superseded by **SeqFu**, a compiled
program providing faster and safer tools for sequence analysis.
This suite is maintained for the higher portability of Perl scripts
under certain circumstances.

SeqFu is available at [https://github.com/telatin/seqfu2](https://github.com/telatin/seqfu2), and
can be installed with BioConda `conda install -c bioconda seqfu`
